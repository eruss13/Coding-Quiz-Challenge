With this application, the user is given four general questions about coding.  For the index.html I included the question choice buttons as well as the 
starting and final screens.  In the questions.js I have all of the question choices as well as the answers.  In my script.js I have all of the functions for the application. The 75 second timer, questions, final score, as well as the logic.
